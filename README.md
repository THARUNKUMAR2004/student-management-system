- ✏️ Edit existing student details
- 🗑️ Delete student records
- ⚡ Real-time UI updates after every action (no page reloads)
- 🎨 Clean, professional UI built with Bootstrap

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.5
- Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
- MySQL
- Maven
- Lombok

**Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- Axios
- Bootstrap 5

## 🏗️ Architecture

The backend follows a standard layered architecture:

```
Controller  →  Service  →  Repository  →  Database
(REST APIs)   (Business     (Spring Data    (MySQL)
               Logic)        JPA)
```
